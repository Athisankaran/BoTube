Those who work hard for their dreams they read their fruits owner other than later it is my pleasure to be invited and to get to meet you an interact with you all since yesterday I been interacting with the student community here at mitche MIT Group of Institutions and adjust kind of makes me remember my own time at college specially the time when I was deciding about my career and when I was thinking of a career and civil services I clearly remember that I ask my father who is also a Civil Servant he is in the Indian Police Service I asked him a very straight forward question I asked him papa after more than two decades in the service do you feel that this particular service this particular career is what the Hike
that exist in our country around it he smile that me any said beta there are both positive and negative obviously you have seen the respect and Prestige that we are civil servants get but you are also seen the work stress depressure the difficulties that come with this career but what this career guess you is a sense of satisfaction the sense of satisfaction you get when you use your authority to help others when you deliver justice to the innocent and that sense of satisfaction is the one that keeps driving us forward and with that vision in my mind stages of life and that is got me here in front of you today you see so many successful
but behind all this happy faces the wholeshared the fair of heart shape of sacrifices and this much never be forgotten each and everyone of his husband through the stuff moments and ultimately I believe that is this ability that has got a SOL here because when we face these times of despair view often thing why is this happening to us but so do all who got to search times but it is not for them to decide will we have to decide is what to do with the time that has been given to us and that time is today I believe in few things but I definitely believe that those who work hard for their dreams for their vision without most sincerity and dedication the read their fruits owner other than later
